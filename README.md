This is a Student Recommender System. It recommends student for the placement on the basis of simple criteria i.e 0 backlogs and percentage must be greater than 60%.
It first accepts no. of student data the admin wants to enter and it will take details of all those students. i.e name , email and marks obtained in all 6 subjetcs.
Then, it will calculate %age and backlog count and recommends student who has 0 backlog and more than 60% to the placement officer.

This is a simple java project i made in my 3rd sem. :^)
